is the next release of OSv since the previous one 0.52.0 was crafted. Unlike previous one this release does deliver new exciting feature - it supports running OSv on new lightweight hypervisor [**firecracker**](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) which makes possible to boot OSv Read-Only FS image in **as low as 5ms** per bootchart. We hope next release will happen before end of second quarter of 2019.\r\n\r\n# Features Highlights\r\n* Enhanced OSv to run on firecracker (for details please see [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-Firecracker))\r\n    * OSv can boot as vmlinux (64-bit ELF - please see loader.elf attached)\r\n    * OSv does not require ACPI to run\r\n    * Added support of virtio mmio devices\r\n* Added support of both legacy and modern virtio 1.0 PCI devices (for details please see [here](http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/cs04/virtio-v1.0-cs04.html#x1-60001))\r\n* Further reduced minimal memory to run OSv to 18MB (25% reduction)\r\n* Fixed critical bug affecting apps doing heavy floating point computations like ffmpeg (see issues #1019, #1020, #1010, #1018, #536)\r\n* Implemented some missing syscalls to better support Golang apps\r\n* Enhanced Python 3 app to support including modules\r\n* Upgraded tomcat app to version 9\r\n* Added support of [graalvm](http://www.graalvm.org/) apps\r\n\r\n# Specifics\r\n* Refactored virtio layer to support legacy and modern PCI and mmio devices\r\n* Implemented modern virtio PCI device\r\n* Enhanced OSv to boot without ACPI present\r\n* Enhanced OSv to discover SMP information by reading MP table if ACPI is not present\r\n* Made OSv bootable as a vmlinux 64-bit ELF\r\n* Added boot option to disable PCI enumeration\r\n* Added virtio mmio implementation\r\n* Made httpserver-api configuration file configurable\r\n* Enhanced ELF dynamic loader to support position dependent shared libraries (Graal VM)\r\n* Deleted “assigned virtio driver\"\r\n* Made memory allocation more efficient \r\n    * Handles small memory allocations ( < 16 bytes) more space efficiently\r\n    * Implemented more space-efficient early memory allocation scheme (reduced memory utilization by 6MB - see #270)\r\n\r\n# Closed issues\r\n* #1030 - Test failure with Fedora Java 8\r\n* #1029 - Debug build fails because tracepoint sections are discarded\r\n* #1028 - scripts/firecracker.py doesn't pass input to OSv\r\n* #1020 - Maybe need to reset fpu status word on context switch\r\n* #1019 - Maybe need to reset fpu state after saving it\r\n* #1018 - OSv crashes sporadically with page fault when transcoding video with ffmpeg\r\n* #1017 - upload_manifest.py opens a port to the world, and always the same port\r\n* #1011 - Make allocations < 16 bytes more space efficient\r\n* #1010 - Memory access fault when OSv pounded by periodic /os/threads REST call\r\n* #1006 - Missing function fcntl64\r\n* #1004 - Handle (either support correctly, or forbid) non-fPIC shared objects\r\n* #956 - Missing readlinkat()\r\n* #536 - Cassandra with CLI crash with cassandra stress\r\n* #270 - Wasted memory in early malloc()\r\n\r\n### List of contributors alphabetically\r\n* Felix Yan (@felixonmars) - 1 patch\r\n* Nadav Har'El (@nyh) - 8 patches\r\n* Przemek Pikuła (@pshem) - 4 patches\r\n* Waldemar Kozaczuk (@wkozaczuk )- 45 patches\r\n* Geraldo Netto (@geraldo-netto) - 6 patches\r\n* Vinícius Fraga (@viniciusmsfra) - 1 patch\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgments\r\nWe want to thank all contributors to the project.
