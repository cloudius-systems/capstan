new release of OSv focuses on improving Linux compatibility and tooling aimed to make it possible to run unmodified Linux apps on OSv \"as-is\".\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\nFrom the beginning, OSv was designed to implement a subset of Linux POSIX API superset. But until this release most Linux applications had to be **re-compiled from source** as shared libraries or some, like Java, rely on OSv version of `/usr/bin/java` wrapper to run. This meant that one could NOT run a Linux executable \"as is\". In other words, OSv has always been *Linux-compatible at source level but not at binary level*.\r\n\r\nThis release offers a breakthrough and allows running unmodified Linux **position-independent executables** (so-called \"pies\") and **position-dependant executables** \"as-is\" as long as they *do not use \"fork/execve\" or other unsupported Linux API*. It means that very often one can take a **binary from Linux host and run it on OSv** without having to locate the source code on the Internet and build it as a shared library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this release makes OSv more Linux-compatible from another end - booting on a hypervisor. The previous release 0.53 made OSv kernel *\"look like\"* ELF64 uncompressed Linux kernel. The new release 0.54 has enhanced OSv loader to *\"look like\"* **vmlinuz** and thus allow booting on Docker's **Hyperkit** on OSX. The OSv loader has also been enhanced to boot as Linux ELF64 **PVH/HVM** loader on QEMU with `--kernel` option.\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n### Linux compatibility\r\n* Applications\r\n  * Enhanced **getopt** family of functions to work correctly with both **position-independent executables** and **position-dependent executables** in order to allow receiving program arguments\r\n  * Enhanced dynamic linker to be capable of executing **position-dependent executables**\r\n  * Mapped kernel higher in virtual memory - from 0x00200000 to **0x40200000** (2nd GiB) in order to make space for position-dependent executables\r\n  * Added new GNU libc extensions: `error()`, `__prognames` and `__progname_full`\r\n  * Added missing pseudo-files to procfs and minimal implementation of **sysfs** in order to support **libnuma** to allow programs like ffmpeg using x265 codec run on OSv \"as-is\"\r\n  * Encanced `/proc/self/maps` to include i-node number and device ID to support GraalVM apps with isolates\r\n  * Enhanced `epoll_pwait()` implementation\r\n  * Improved dynamic linker by making it:\r\n    * Ignore old version symbols so that new version symbols are resolved correctly instead\r\n    * Delay resolving symbols found missing during `relocate_rela()` phase for certain relocation types to allow more unmodified Linux executables run on OSv\r\n    * Handle DT_RUNPATH\r\n* Booting\r\n  * Added vmlinuz-compatible version of the kernel to allow OSv boot on Docker's Hyperkit\r\n  * Enhanced loader to support [PVH/HVM](https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10741013/) boot to allow OSV run on QEMU with `--kernel` option\r\n  * Added support of QEMU 4.x\r\n  * Enhanced HPET driver to support 32-bit main counter\r\n### Filesystem improvements\r\n* VFS\r\n  * Hardened implementation of `open()/sys_open()/task_conv()` to handle null path\r\n  * Enhanced `__fxstata` to handle `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`\r\n* RAMFS\r\n  * Greatly improved speed of write/append operations\r\n  * Fixed bugs\r\n    * Delay freeing data until i-node closed\r\n    * Keep i-node number the same\r\n### Tools\r\n* Added script `manifest_from_host.sh` to allow building images from artifacts on Linux host “as-is” without need to compile\r\n* Added script `build-capstan-mpm-packages` to create capstan MPM packages\r\n* Added Ubuntu- and Fedora-based Docker files to help create build and test environment\r\n* Enhanced `test.py` to allow executing unit tests on Firecracker\r\n### Bugs and other enhancements\r\n* Fixed `sem_trywait()` that for example allows Java 12 run properly on OSv\r\n* Improved memory utilization by using memory below the kernel\r\n* Introduced new command line suffix `!` allowing to force termination of lingering threads\r\n* Revamped building of the `cli` and `httpserver` apps to use OpenSSL 1.1 and Lua 5.3 and minimize compilation\r\n* Tweaked OSv code to support compilation by GCC 9\r\n### Improved Documentation\r\n* Refreshed main README\r\n* OSv-apps\r\n* Scripts   \r\n### Apps\r\n* Added number of `*-from-host` apps that demonstrate building images out of binaries from Linux host:\r\n  * Java\r\n  * Python\r\n  * Node\r\n  * Lua\r\n  * Ffmpeg \r\n* Added demo app - `openjdk12-jre-from-docker` that creates an image out of a Docker image\r\n* Added demo app that demonstrates running GraalVM isolates\r\n* Added an example of a basic mono app\r\n* Improved support of Golang PIEs \r\n\r\n# Closed issues\r\n* #1050 - Can't run anything with 1.01G of memory\r\n* #1049 - tst_huge hangs with memory over 1GB.\r\n* #1048 - VM with memory larger than 4GB doesn't boot\r\n* #1043 - Map kernel higher in virtual memory\r\n* #1039 - Handle new DT_RUNPATH in object::load_needed()\r\n* #1035 - iperf3 fails with exception nested to deeply on ROFS/RamFS image\r\n* #1034 - Build failures when build directory's pathname has a space\r\n* #1031 - The graalvm-example fails with graalvm 1.0.0-rc13\r\n* #1026 - golang-pie-httpserver crashes on control-C\r\n* #1023 - Ignore missing symbols when loading objects with BIND_NOW in relocate_rela()\r\n* #1022 - lua package requires openssl 1.0\r\n* #1012 - Improve physical memory

We hope next release will happen before end of second quarter of 2019.\r\n\r\n# Features Highlights\r\n* Enhanced OSv to run on firecracker (for details please see [here](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Running-OSv-on-Firecracker))\r\n    * OSv can boot as vmlinux (64-bit ELF - please see loader.elf attached)\r\n    * OSv does not require ACPI to run\r\n    * Added support of virtio mmio devices\r\n* Added support of both legacy and modern virtio 1.0 PCI devices (for details please see [here](http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/cs04/virtio-v1.0-cs04.html#x1-60001))\r\n* Further reduced minimal memory to run OSv to 18MB (25% reduction)\r\n* Fixed critical bug affecting apps doing heavy floating point computations like ffmpeg (see issues #1019, #1020, #1010, #1018, #536)\r\n* Implemented some missing syscalls to better support Golang apps\r\n* Enhanced Python 3 app to support including modules\r\n* Upgraded tomcat app to version 9\r\n* Added support of [graalvm](http://www.graalvm.org/) apps\r\n\r\n# Specifics\r\n* Refactored virtio layer to support legacy and modern PCI and mmio devices\r\n* Implemented modern virtio PCI device\r\n* Enhanced OSv to boot without ACPI present\r\n* Enhanced OSv to discover SMP information by reading MP table if ACPI is not present\r\n* Made OSv bootable as a vmlinux 64-bit ELF\r\n* Added boot option to disable PCI enumeration\r\n* Added virtio mmio implementation\r\n* Made httpserver-api configuration file configurable\r\n* Enhanced ELF dynamic loader to support position dependent shared libraries (Graal VM)\r\n* Deleted “assigned virtio driver\"\r\n* Made memory allocation more efficient \r\n    * Handles small memory allocations ( < 16 bytes) more space efficiently\r\n    * Implemented more space-efficient early memory allocation scheme (reduced memory utilization by 6MB - see #270)\r\n\r\n# Closed issues\r\n* #1030 - Test failure with Fedora Java 8\r\n* #1029 - Debug build fails because tracepoint sections are discarded\r\n* #1028 - scripts/firecracker.py doesn't pass input to OSv\r\n* #1020 - Maybe need to reset fpu status word on context switch\r\n* #1019 - Maybe need to reset fpu state after saving it\r\n* #1018 - OSv crashes sporadically with page fault when transcoding video with ffmpeg\r\n* #1017 - upload_manifest.py opens a port to the world, and always the same port\r\n* #1011 - Make allocations < 16 bytes more space efficient\r\n* #1010 - Memory access fault when OSv pounded by periodic /os/threads REST call\r\n* #1006 - Missing function fcntl64\r\n* #1004 - Handle (either support correctly, or forbid) non-fPIC shared objects\r\n* #956 - Missing readlinkat()\r\n* #536 - Cassandra with CLI crash with cassandra stress\r\n* #270 - Wasted memory in early malloc()\r\n\r\n### List of contributors alphabetically\r\n* Felix Yan (@felixonmars) - 1 patch\r\n* Nadav Har'El (@nyh) - 8 patches\r\n* Przemek Pikuła (@pshem) - 4 patches\r\n* Waldemar Kozaczuk (@wkozaczuk )- 45 patches\r\n* Geraldo Netto (@geraldo-netto) - 6 patches\r\n* Vinícius Fraga (@viniciusmsfra) - 1 patch\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgments\r\nWe want to thank all contributors to the project. But the special thanks go to:\r\n- Nadav Har’El for contributing and reviewing many patches and providing guidance for many others\r\n- Waldemar Kozaczuk for contributing most patches\r\n\r\n#
